    <!-- This below is how we import the "Socket.io" LIBRARY, with this in place NOW inside the Browser we have
    access to ALL sorts of METHODS available in the Library itself, one of those methods is going to let us
    INITIATE a connection request and that is EXACTLY what we're going to do here down below(in the SECOND 
    'script') -->

        /* This 'io()' method is AVAILABLE because we just loaded the "Socket.io" library here above, when we're
        CALLING this method we're actually INITIATING the request, so we're making a request from the CLIENT to
        Servet to OPEN UP a "Web Socket" and KEEP that connection OPEN. So we're CREATING the connection(with the
        'io()' CALL) and storing it inside a 'socket' variable and THIS variable is CRITICAL to communicating.
        It's EXACTLY what we need in order to LISTEN for Data from the Server AND in order to send Data to the
        Server. */

            /* This message will SHOW inside the CONSOLE of the Chrome Browser in the Dev Tools. As soon as the
            Connection HAPPENS, the Client and the Server they BOTH had that EVENT fired, the Client pint the
            message "Connected to server" and the Server prints "New user connected"(we have this message inside
            the 'server.js' file) */

        /* Here below we call 'socket.on' again to LISTEN to an EVENT, the event in THIS case is the 'disconnect'
        and this 'disconnect' NAME must be correct because is a BUILT-IN Event, so it's ONLY going to work if we
        TYPE it CORRECTLY. This 'disconnect' EVENT is going to fire when ever the connection DROP, for example
        if the server goes down the CLIENT is going to be able to DO something but for NOW that something is just
        going to be a message that we print on the screen */
